              <p>
                This policy explains how ALTR approaches supplier confidentiality, analytical verification, batch
                documentation and quality review for the research-use-only compounds we supply. Our aim is to be
                clear about what we verify, what we document, and why we don&apos;t publish specific supplier
                identities or sourcing locations.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                We evaluate products on testing, documentation, batch integrity and release standards — not
                marketing claims tied to a country of origin.

            <PolicySection id="approach" num="2" title="Our Sourcing Approach">
              <p>
                ALTR works with vetted manufacturing and supply partners to keep research compounds consistently
                available. Products may move through different supply channels depending on availability,
                production schedules, inventory planning and quality requirements.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                We don&apos;t represent a product as better or worse based on geographic origin alone. Instead, we
                focus on standards we can actually verify:

              <p>
                ALTR works with a network of vetted manufacturing and supply partners. Consistent with standard
                practice across pharmaceutical, research, specialty-chemical and laboratory-supply chains, we don&apos;t
                publish specific manufacturers, laboratories, supplier names, production facilities or sourcing
                locations.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Keeping supplier details confidential protects supply-chain integrity, supports long-term quality
                partnerships, reduces disruption risk, and helps us keep quality consistent from batch to batch.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-sm font-semibold text-charcoal">
                Confidentiality doesn&apos;t replace verification — we still use analytical documentation and batch
                review to decide what actually ships.

              <p>
                Every product goes through quality review before release. Where applicable, we use independent
                third-party analytical testing to verify identity, purity and related quality attributes against
                our internal benchmarks.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                That review can include analytical documentation, batch inspection, label verification, lot
                tracking, and comparison against our internal acceptance standards. Every product meets these
                requirements before distribution, regardless of supplier or region.
